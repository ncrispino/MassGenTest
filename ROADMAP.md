## 📋 v0.1.13 - Intelligent Tool Selection & NLIP Integration

### Features

**1. Automatic MCP Tool Selection** (@ncrispino)
- Issue: [#414](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/414)
- Intelligent selection of MCP tools before task execution based on user prompts
- Dynamic tool refinement during execution as task requirements evolve
- Filesystem-first approach where MCPs appear as files rather than in-context specifications
- Reduces context pollution from excessive in-context tools (currently >30)
- Eliminates manual tool selection burden for users
- **Use Case**: Intelligently select appropriate MCP tools (e.g., Playwright for web testing) based on task requirements, improving performance without requiring users to know which tools to include

**2. NLIP Integration** (@qidanrui)
- PR: [#475](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/pull/475) (Draft)
- Natural Language Integration Platform for enhanced agent coordination
- Hierarchy initialization for structured multi-agent systems
- Reinforcement learning integration components
- Advanced orchestration patterns with NLIP architecture
- Foundation for sophisticated agent coordination strategies
- **Use Case**: Enable advanced multi-agent coordination through NLIP's hierarchy and reinforcement learning capabilities, improving agent collaboration and decision-making

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Automatic tool selection improves task performance vs manual selection
- ✅ Context pollution reduced through filesystem-first approach
- ✅ Tool selection adapts dynamically during execution
- ✅ NLIP hierarchy initialization works correctly
- ✅ Reinforcement learning components integrate seamlessly
- ✅ Advanced orchestration patterns demonstrate improved performance

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Terminal recording and playback system works reliably
- ✅ Video understanding capabilities accurately analyze terminal sessions
- ✅ Automated case study generation produces high-quality documentation
- ✅ MassGen successfully self-improves based on terminal analysis

---

- Standard methodology for efficiency evaluation and benchmarking
- Optimized file I/O for multi-agent scenarios
- Performance metrics and monitoring framework
- Comprehensive efficiency evaluation with standard metrics
- **Use Case**: Increase parallelism and efficiency with standard evaluation metrics, reducing file operation latency in multi-agent workflows

**2. Launch Custom Tools in Docker** (@ncrispino)
- Issue: [#510](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/510)
- Enable custom tools to run in isolated Docker containers
- Automatic containerization of custom tool execution
- Security isolation for untrusted or experimental tools
- Improved portability across different environments
- Resource management and cleanup for tool containers

- **Use Case**: Run custom tools in isolated Docker containers for enhanced security, enabling safe execution of untrusted code and ensuring consistent tool behavior across environments

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Parallel file reads demonstrate measurable performance improvement
- ✅ Efficiency evaluation framework established with clear metrics
- ✅ Standard evaluation methodology implemented and documented
- ✅ Benchmarking shows improvements in real-world scenarios
- ✅ Feature maintains data consistency and safety
- ✅ Custom tools successfully launch in Docker containers
- ✅ Security isolation prevents tools from affecting host system
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of Docker resources after tool execution
- ✅ Tool execution performance comparable to native execution
