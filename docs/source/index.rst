MassGen is a cutting-edge multi-agent system that leverages the power of collaborative AI to solve complex tasks. It assigns a task to multiple AI agents who work in parallel, observe each other's progress, and refine their approaches to converge on the best solution to deliver a comprehensive and high-quality result. The power of this "parallel study group" approach is exemplified by advanced systems like xAI's Grok Heavy and Google DeepMind's Gemini Deep Think.

What is MassGen?
-----------------

MassGen assigns your task to multiple AI agents who work in parallel, observe each other's progress, and refine their approaches to converge on the best solution. The system delivers comprehensive, high-quality results by leveraging the collective intelligence of multiple AI models.

**How It Works:**

* **Work in Parallel** - Multiple agents tackle the problem simultaneously, each bringing unique capabilities
* **See Recent Answers** - At each step, agents view the most recent answers from other agents
* **Decide Next Action** - Each agent chooses to provide a new answer or vote for an existing answer
* **Share Workspaces** - When agents provide answers, their workspace is captured so others can review their work
* **Natural Consensus** - Coordination continues until all agents vote, then the agent with most votes presents the final answer

Think of it as a "parallel study group" for AI - inspired by advanced systems like **xAI's Grok Heavy** and **Google DeepMind's Gemini Deep Think**. Agents learn from each other to produce better results than any single agent could achieve alone.

This project extends the classic "multi-agent conversation" idea from `AG2 <https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2>`_ with "threads of thought" and "iterative refinement" concepts presented in `The Myth of Reasoning <https://docs.ag2.ai/latest/docs/blog/2025/04/16/Reasoning/>`_.

Quick Start
-----------

Get started with MassGen in minutes. First, ensure you have Python 3.11+ and pip installed, then create a virtual environment with uv:
.. code-block:: bash

   uv venv

**Install:**

.. code-block:: bash

   uv pip install massgen

**Option 1: Use the setup wizard (recommended for first time):**

.. code-block:: bash

   # Run without arguments to launch the interactive setup wizard
   uv run massgen

The wizard will guide you through configuring your API keys and creating your first agent team.

After setup, you can:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Run a single query with your configured agents
   uv run massgen "Your question here"

   # Or start an interactive conversation (no prompt needed)
   uv run massgen

**Option 2: Quick single-agent test:**

.. code-block:: bash

   # No config needed - specify model directly
   uv run massgen --model gemini-2.5-flash "What are LLM agents?"

**Option 3: Multi-agent collaboration:**

.. code-block:: bash

   # Use a built-in configuration
   uv run massgen --config @examples/basic/multi/three_agents_default \
     "What are the pros and cons of renewable energy?"

Watch agents discuss, vote, and converge on the best answer in real-time!

* :doc:`examples/basic_examples` - Copy-paste ready examples

Supported Models
----------------

MassGen supports a wide range of AI models across different providers:

**API-based Models:**

* **Claude** (Anthropic): Haiku, Sonnet, Opus series
* **Gemini** (Google): Flash, Pro series with MCP support
* **GPT** (OpenAI): GPT-4, GPT-5 series
* **Grok** (xAI): Grok-3, Grok-4 series
* **Azure OpenAI**: Enterprise deployments
* And :doc:`many more <reference/supported_models>`...

**Local Models:**

* **LM Studio**: Run open-weight models locally
* **vLLM & SGLang**: Unified inference backend

**External Frameworks:**

* **AG2** Agents with code execution capabilities

.. tip::
   **Choosing the right backend?** Different models have different strengths. See the complete **Backend Capabilities Matrix** in :doc:`user_guide/backends` to understand which features (web search, code execution, file operations, etc.) are available for each model.

Core Concepts
-------------

**Simple CLI Interface**
   Get started with just ``massgen`` - install via pip, run the interactive setup wizard, and you're ready to go.

**Multi-Agent Coordination**
   Multiple agents work in parallel, observe each other's progress, and reach consensus through natural collaboration with real-time visualization.

**Interactive Multi-Turn Mode**
   Have ongoing conversations with your multi-agent team! Session history is preserved in the ``.massgen/sessions/`` directory, allowing you to continue conversations across multiple sessions with full context preservation.

**Flexible Model Support**
   Use Claude, Gemini, GPT, Grok, and more - each agent can use a different model. Mix and match models for optimal results.

**MCP Tool Integration**
   Extend agent capabilities with Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools. Supports planning mode to prevent irreversible actions during coordination.

**Workspace Isolation & File Operations**
   Each agent gets its own isolated workspace for safe file operations. The ``.massgen/`` directory keeps all MassGen files organized and separate from your project.

**Project Integration**
   Work directly with your existing codebases! Use context paths to grant agents read/write access to specific directories with granular permission control.

**Configuration**
   After using the setup wizard, customize your agent teams via YAML configuration files for advanced scenarios.
