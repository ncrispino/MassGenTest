Planning Mode
=============

Planning Mode enables agents to coordinate and plan their approaches **without executing irreversible actions**. Only the winning agent executes the final plan during presentation, preventing conflicts and unintended side effects during multi-agent coordination.

.. note::

   **New in v0.0.29**: Planning mode is especially powerful for MCP tool usage, preventing agents from executing external API calls, file operations, or database modifications during coordination.

Quick Start
-----------

**Five agents planning with filesystem tools:**

.. code-block:: bash

   massgen \
     --config @examples/tools/planning/five_agents_filesystem_mcp_planning_mode.yaml \
     "Create a comprehensive project structure with documentation"

**Example with MCP tools:**

.. code-block:: bash

   massgen \
     --config @examples/tools/mcp/five_agents_weather_mcp_test.yaml \
     "Compare weather forecasts for New York, London, and Tokyo"

What is Planning Mode?
-----------------------

Planning mode separates multi-agent coordination into two distinct phases:

1. **Coordination Phase** - Agents discuss, analyze, and vote on approaches **without executing actions**
2. **Presentation Phase** - Only the winning agent executes the agreed-upon plan

Without Planning Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Standard coordination** allows all agents to execute actions immediately:

.. code-block:: text

   ❌ Agent A creates file "output.txt" with content X
   ❌ Agent B creates file "output.txt" with content Y (overwrites!)
   ❌ Agent C creates file "output.txt" with content Z (overwrites again!)
   → Result: Chaos, lost work, conflicting changes

With Planning Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Planning mode** prevents execution during coordination:

.. code-block:: text

   ✅ Agent A: "I would create output.txt with content X because..."
   ✅ Agent B: "I would create output.txt with content Y because..."
   ✅ Agent C: "I agree with Agent B's approach" [votes for B]
   ✅ Agent A: "Agent B's approach is better" [votes for B]
   → Winner: Agent B
   → Agent B executes: Creates output.txt with content Y (no conflicts!)

When to Use Planning Mode
--------------------------

Use planning mode for tasks involving irreversible or conflicting operations:

File System Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ✅ File creation, modification, deletion
* ✅ Directory structure changes
* ✅ Batch file operations

.. code-block:: yaml

   orchestrator:
     coordination:
       enable_planning_mode: true

**Why**: Prevents multiple agents from creating/deleting the same files during coordination.

MCP External Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ✅ API calls (weather, search, notifications)
* ✅ Database operations
* ✅ External service integrations (Twitter, Discord, Notion)

.. code-block:: bash

   # Weather API example with planning mode
   massgen \
     --config @examples/tools/mcp/five_agents_weather_mcp_test.yaml \
     "Get weather data for multiple cities"

**Why**: Prevents redundant API calls, rate limiting issues, and conflicting external state changes.

State-Changing Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ✅ Database writes
* ✅ Sending messages/emails
* ✅ Creating issues/tickets
* ✅ Publishing content

**Why**: These operations can't be easily undone or rolled back.

When NOT to Use Planning Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Planning mode adds coordination overhead. Skip it for:

* ❌ Pure analysis tasks (no side effects)
* ❌ Read-only operations
* ❌ Single-agent tasks
* ❌ Tasks where parallel execution is beneficial

Configuration
-------------

Basic Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enable planning mode in the ``orchestrator`` section:

.. code-block:: yaml

   orchestrator:
     coordination:
       enable_planning_mode: true

Agents will automatically plan without executing during coordination.

Custom Planning Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Customize the planning behavior with instructions:

.. code-block:: yaml

   orchestrator:
     coordination:
       enable_planning_mode: true
       planning_mode_instruction: |
         PLANNING MODE ACTIVE: You are in the coordination phase.

         During this phase:
         1. Describe your intended approach and reasoning
         2. Analyze other agents' proposals
         3. Use 'vote' or 'new_answer' tools for coordination
         4. DO NOT execute filesystem operations, API calls, or state changes
         5. Save all execution for the final presentation phase

         Focus on planning, analysis, and coordination rather than execution.

Complete Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Full configuration with planning mode for filesystem operations:

.. code-block:: yaml

   agents:
     - id: "agent_a"
       backend:
         type: "gemini"
         model: "gemini-2.5-flash"
         cwd: "workspace_a"  # File operations handled via cwd

     - id: "agent_b"
       backend:
         type: "openai"
         model: "gpt-5-nano"
         cwd: "workspace_b"  # File operations handled via cwd

   orchestrator:
     snapshot_storage: "snapshots"
     agent_temporary_workspace: "temp_workspaces"
     coordination:
       enable_planning_mode: true
       planning_mode_instruction: |
         During coordination, describe what you would do without executing.
         Only the winning agent will implement the plan.

   ui:
     display_type: "rich_terminal"
     logging_enabled: true

Orchestration Restart
---------------------

Planning mode works well with **orchestration restart** - a feature that automatically restarts coordination when answers are incomplete.

   :doc:`orchestration_restart` - Complete guide to automatic quality checks, per-attempt logging, and self-correcting workflows

How Planning Mode Works
------------------------

Coordination Phase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During coordination with planning mode enabled:

1. **Agents receive planning instructions** automatically
2. **Agents describe approaches** without execution
3. **Coordination tools remain available**: ``vote`` and ``new_answer``
4. **MCP/filesystem tools are NOT blocked** - agents must follow instructions not to use them
5. **Agents vote** for the best approach

.. note::

   Planning mode relies on agents following instructions. It's not a technical block but a behavioral guideline. Agents with strong instruction-following (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini) respect planning mode well.

Presentation Phase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After coordination completes:

1. **Winner selected** based on votes
2. **Planning mode disabled** for winner
3. **Winner executes the plan** with full tool access
4. **Results saved** and returned to user

Example Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Task**: "Create a project structure with src/, tests/, and docs/ directories"

**Coordination Phase** (Planning Mode Active):

.. code-block:: text

   Round 1:
   --------
   Agent A: "I would create three directories: src/ for source code,
            tests/ for test files, and docs/ for documentation.
            Then I would add README files to each." [new_answer]

   Agent B: "I would do the same but also add __init__.py files to
            make src/ and tests/ proper Python packages." [new_answer]

   Agent C: "Agent B's approach is more complete." [votes for B]

   Round 2:
   --------
   Agent A: "Good point about __init__.py" [votes for B]
   Agent B: [already provided answer]
   Agent C: [already voted]

   → All agents voted
   → Winner: Agent B (2 votes)

**Presentation Phase** (Planning Mode Disabled):

.. code-block:: text

   Agent B executes:
   - create_directory("src")
   - write_file("src/__init__.py", "")
   - create_directory("tests")
   - write_file("tests/__init__.py", "")
   - create_directory("docs")
   - write_file("docs/README.md", "# Documentation")

   ✅ Complete! Clean execution without conflicts.

Benefits
--------

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ✅ Agents refine ideas through coordination
* ✅ Best approach wins through voting
* ✅ Implementation reflects consensus

Resource Efficiency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ✅ Prevents wasted API calls during coordination
* ✅ Single execution reduces costs
* ✅ Avoids rate limiting issues

Auditability
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ✅ Detailed logs of coordination decisions

Examples by Use Case
--------------------

Example 1: Project Structure Creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Config**: ``@examples/tools/planning/five_agents_filesystem_mcp_planning_mode.yaml``

.. code-block:: bash

   massgen \
     --config @examples/tools/planning/five_agents_filesystem_mcp_planning_mode.yaml \
     "Create a Python microservice project with src/, tests/, docker/, and docs/ directories. Add starter files."

**Result**: Agents discuss the ideal structure, vote on the best approach, then winning agent creates everything cleanly.

Example 2: Weather Data Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Config**: ``@examples/tools/mcp/five_agents_weather_mcp_test.yaml``

.. code-block:: bash

   massgen \
     --config @examples/tools/mcp/five_agents_weather_mcp_test.yaml \
     "Fetch weather data for San Francisco, New York, and London. Compare temperatures."

**Result**: Agents plan the API calls, agree on data format, then winning agent makes the actual requests.

Example 3: Social Media Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Config**: ``@examples/tools/planning/five_agents_twitter_mcp_planning_mode.yaml``

.. code-block:: bash

   massgen \
     --config @examples/tools/planning/five_agents_twitter_mcp_planning_mode.yaml \
     "Analyze recent tweets about AI and post a summary"

**Result**: Agents plan search queries and post content without actually posting during coordination.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Agents Executing During Coordination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Problem**: Agents are executing actions despite planning mode being enabled.

**Solutions**:

1. **Check your configuration**:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      orchestrator:
        coordination:
          enable_planning_mode: true  # Make sure this is set

2. **Strengthen planning instructions**:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      orchestrator:
        coordination:
          planning_mode_instruction: |
            IMPORTANT: DO NOT execute any operations during coordination.
            You are in PLANNING MODE - describe what you would do.

3. **Use backends with strong instruction following**: Claude, GPT-4/5, Gemini 2.0+

4. **Add explicit instructions to agent system messages**:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      agents:
        - id: "agent_a"
          system_message: |
            During coordination, you must ONLY plan and discuss.
            Do not execute filesystem, API, or state-changing operations.

Coordination Takes Too Long
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Problem**: Agents spend many rounds discussing without converging.

**Solutions**:

1. **Add timeout configuration**:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      timeout_settings:
        orchestrator_timeout_seconds: 600  # 10 minutes

2. **Use fewer agents** for simpler tasks

3. **Provide clearer task descriptions**

4. **Add voting guidance to system messages**

Best Practices
--------------

1. **Enable for irreversible operations**: Always use planning mode for file operations, API calls, or database changes

2. **Custom instructions for complex tasks**: Tailor ``planning_mode_instruction`` to your specific use case

3. **Clear task descriptions**: Help agents understand what needs planning vs immediate action

4. **Monitor coordination rounds**: Check logs to see if planning is effective

5. **Test with smaller agent teams first**: Start with 2-3 agents before scaling to 5+

6. **Set appropriate timeouts**: Some tasks need more coordination time
