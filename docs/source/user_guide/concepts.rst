Core Concepts
=============

Understanding MassGen's core concepts is essential for using the system effectively.

What is MassGen?
-----------------

MassGen is a **multi-agent coordination system** that assigns tasks to multiple AI agents who work in parallel, share observations, vote for solutions, and converge on the best answer through natural consensus.

Think of it as a "parallel study group" for AI - agents learn from each other to produce better results than any single agent could achieve alone.

Configuration-Driven Architecture
----------------------------------

MassGen uses **YAML files** to configure everything, not Python code.

.. code-block:: yaml

   agents:
     - id: "researcher"
       backend:
         type: "gemini"
         model: "gemini-2.5-flash"
       system_message: "You are a researcher"

     - id: "analyst"
       backend:
         type: "openai"
         model: "gpt-5-nano"
       system_message: "You are an analyst"

Run via command line:

.. code-block:: bash

   massgen --config config.yaml "Your question"

This design makes MassGen:

* **Declarative** - Describe what you want, not how to do it
* **Version-controllable** - Config files in Git
* **Shareable** - Easy to share and reproduce setups
* **Language-agnostic** - No Python required for most users

.. seealso::
   :doc:`../quickstart/configuration` - Complete configuration guide with all options and examples

CLI-Based Execution
-------------------

MassGen is currently run via command line (a Python library API is planned for future releases):

**Quick single agent:**

.. code-block:: bash

   massgen --model claude-3-5-sonnet-latest "Question"

**Multi-agent with config:**

.. code-block:: bash

   massgen --config my_agents.yaml "Question"

**Interactive mode:**

.. code-block:: bash

   # Omit question for interactive chat
   massgen --config my_agents.yaml

See :doc:`../reference/cli` for complete CLI reference.

Multi-Agent Coordination
-------------------------

How Coordination Works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MassGen's coordination follows a natural collaborative flow where agents observe each other's work and converge on the best solution:

**At each step, agents can:**

1. **See recent answers** - Agents view the most recent answers from other agents
2. **Decide their action** - Each agent chooses to either:

   * **Provide a new answer** if they have a better approach or refinement
   * **Vote for an existing answer** they believe is best

3. **Share context through workspace snapshots** (if file operations are enabled) - When agents provide answers, their workspace state is captured, allowing other agents to see their work

**Coordination completes when:**

* All agents have voted for solutions
* The agent with most votes becomes the final presenter

**Final presentation:**

* The winning agent delivers the coordinated final answer, using read/write permissions (if using filesystem operations and configured with context paths)

Coordination Flow Diagram

**Key Insights:**

* **Asynchronous evaluation** - No "rounds", agents evaluate continuously and independently
* **Anonymized answers** - Agents don't know who provided which answer, reducing bias
* **Actual agent prompt** - Agents evaluate "Does best CURRENT ANSWER address ORIGINAL MESSAGE well?"
* **Inject-and-continue** - When any agent uses `new_answer` tool, other agents receive an update mid-work and continue (preserving their thinking), rather than restarting from scratch
* **Natural consensus** - Coordination ends only when all agents vote (no agent provides new_answer)
* **Democratic selection** - Winner determined by peer voting

What Agents See
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Answer Context:**

Each agent sees the most recent answers from other agents **anonymously**. Answers are presented without attribution to reduce bias.

**Key Points:**

* **Anonymized evaluation** - Agents don't know which agent provided which answer
* **Focus on content** - Decisions based on answer quality, not agent identity
* **Bias reduction** - Prevents agents from favoring certain models or deferring to "authority"
* **Original message** - All agents always see the initial user query
* **Best current answer** - Agents evaluate if the best available answer is sufficient

This anonymous evaluation lets agents:

* Compare different approaches objectively
* Build on good insights regardless of source
* Catch potential errors without bias
* Decide whether to vote or provide a better answer based purely on merit

**Workspace Snapshots (for file operations):**

When an agent with filesystem capabilities provides an answer:

* Their workspace is saved as a snapshot
* Other agents can see this snapshot in their temporary workspace
* This enables code review, file analysis, and iterative refinement

Example: If Agent A writes code and provides answer "agent_a.1", Agent B can review that code in ``.massgen/temp_workspaces/agent_a/`` before deciding to vote or provide improvements.

Voting Mechanism
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:term:`Agents<Agent>` participate in democratic decision-making by evaluating solutions and voting for the best answer:

**Voting Process:**

1. Each agent reviews answers from other agents
2. Agent decides: "Is there a better answer than mine?"
3. If YES → Vote for the better answer
4. If NO → Continue with their own answer or refine it

**Natural Consensus:**

The system reaches :term:`consensus` when all agents have voted. No forced agreement - agents vote for what they genuinely believe is best based on their evaluation criteria.

**Example Scenario:**

* **Agent A** (Researcher) - Provides detailed research → Votes for Agent C's synthesis
* **Agent B** (Analyst) - Provides data analysis → Votes for Agent C's synthesis
* **Agent C** (Synthesizer) - Combines insights → Votes for self (believes synthesis is best)

**Result:** Agent C wins with 3 votes (including self-vote) and presents the final answer.

Benefits of Multi-Agent Approach
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Diverse Perspectives** - Different models, different insights
* **Error Correction** - Agents catch each other's mistakes
* **Collaborative Refinement** - Ideas build on each other
* **Quality Convergence** - Natural selection of best solutions
* **Robustness** - System works even if some agents fail

Coordination Termination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Coordination ends when one of these conditions is met:

**Normal Completion:**

* ✅ **All agents have voted** - Consensus reached naturally
* ✅ **Winner selected** - Agent with most votes presents final answer

**Timeout:**

* ⏰ **Orchestrator timeout reached** (default: 30 minutes)
* System saves current state and terminates gracefully
* Partial results preserved

**Typical Duration:**

* Simple tasks: 1-5 minutes (2-3 coordination rounds)
* Standard tasks: 5-15 minutes (3-5 rounds)
* Complex tasks: 15-30 minutes (5-10 rounds)

**Configuration:**

.. code-block:: yaml

   timeout_settings:
     orchestrator_timeout_seconds: 1800  # 30 minutes (default)

**CLI Override:**

.. code-block:: bash

   massgen --orchestrator-timeout 600 --config config.yaml

See :doc:`../reference/timeouts` for complete timeout documentation.

Agents & Backends
-----------------

Agent Definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each :term:`agent` has:

* **ID**: Unique identifier
* **Backend**: :term:`LLM provider<Backend>` (Claude, Gemini, GPT, etc.)
* **Model**: Specific model version
* **System Message**: Role and instructions (:term:`system prompt<System Message>`)
* **Tools**: Optional :term:`MCP servers<MCP Server>` or native capabilities

Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   agents:
     - id: "code_expert"
       backend:
         type: "claude_code"
         model: "sonnet"
         cwd: "workspace"
       system_message: "You are a coding expert with file operations"

Backend Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MassGen supports multiple :term:`backend` providers:

* **API-based**: Claude, Gemini, GPT, Grok, Azure OpenAI, Z AI
* **Local**: LM Studio, vLLM, SGLang
* **External Frameworks**: AG2

Each backend type has different capabilities. See :doc:`../reference/supported_models` for details.

Workspace Isolation
-------------------

Each :term:`agent` gets an isolated :term:`workspace` for file operations, preventing interference during :term:`coordination phase`.

**What is a Workspace?**

A workspace is an agent's private directory where it can:

* Read, write, and edit files freely
* Execute code and scripts
* Create directory structures
* Perform file operations without affecting other agents

All workspaces are stored under ``.massgen/workspaces/`` in your project directory.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: yaml

   agents:
     - id: "writer"
       backend:
         type: "claude_code"
         cwd: "writer_workspace"    # Isolated workspace: .massgen/workspaces/writer_workspace/

     - id: "reviewer"
       backend:
         type: "gemini"
         cwd: "reviewer_workspace"  # Separate workspace: .massgen/workspaces/reviewer_workspace/

**Benefits of Isolation:**

* **No conflicts** - Agents can't accidentally overwrite each other's files
* **Parallel work** - Multiple agents modify files simultaneously
* **Clean state** - Each agent starts with a fresh workspace
* **Workspace sharing** - Agents can review each other's workspaces via :term:`snapshots<Snapshot>`

.. seealso::
   :doc:`files/file_operations` - Complete workspace management guide including directory structure, snapshots, and safety features

MCP Tool Integration
--------------------

MassGen integrates tools via :term:`Model Context Protocol (MCP)<MCP (Model Context Protocol)>`, enabling access to web search, weather, :term:`file operations<File Operation>`, and many other external services.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: yaml

   backend:
     type: "gemini"
     model: "gemini-2.5-flash"
     mcp_servers:
       - name: "search"
         type: "stdio"
         command: "npx"
         args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search"]

.. seealso::
   :doc:`tools/mcp_integration` - Complete MCP guide including common servers, tool filtering, planning mode, and security considerations

Project Integration
-------------------

Work directly with your existing codebase using :term:`context paths<Context Path>` with granular read/write permissions.

**What is a Context Path?**

A context path is a shared directory that agents can access during collaboration. Unlike isolated :term:`workspaces<Workspace>`, context paths allow agents to:

* **Read** your existing project files for analysis
* **Write** to your project (only the :term:`final agent` during presentation)
* **Reference** code, documentation, or data from your real project

**Key Features:**

* **Permission control** - Specify ``read`` or ``write`` access per path
* **Coordination safety** - All paths are read-only during coordination
* **Final agent writes** - Only the winning agent can write during final presentation
* **Protected paths** - Mark specific files as read-only even within writable paths

**Example:**

.. code-block:: yaml

   orchestrator:
     context_paths:
       - path: "/Users/me/project/src"
         permission: "read"       # All agents can analyze code
       - path: "/Users/me/project/docs"
         permission: "write"      # Final agent can update docs
         protected_paths:
           - "README.md"          # Keep README read-only

All MassGen state organized under ``.massgen/`` directory in your project root.

.. seealso::
   * :doc:`files/project_integration` - Complete project integration guide
   * :doc:`files/protected_paths` - Protect specific files within writable paths
   * :doc:`files/file_operations` - File operation safety features

Interactive Multi-Turn Mode
----------------------------

Start MassGen without a question for interactive chat with context preservation across turns.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Single agent interactive
   massgen --model gemini-2.5-flash

   # Multi-agent interactive
   massgen --config my_agents.yaml

**Key Features:**

* **Context preservation** - :term:`Sessions<Session>` are automatically saved and restored
* **Multi-turn coordination** - Full coordination process runs for each turn
* **Workspace persistence** - File operations persist across turns
* **Tool integration** - :term:`MCP tools<MCP Server>` work seamlessly across turns
* **Session management** - Resume previous conversations or start fresh

**Tool Running in Multi-Turn:**

When using MCP tools or file operations in :term:`multi-turn mode`:

* Tools execute during each turn's coordination
* Workspace state is preserved in ``.massgen/sessions/``
* Subsequent turns can access previous turn's files and data
* Planning mode can be enabled to prevent premature tool execution

**Example Session:**

.. code-block:: bash

   Turn 1: "Create a website about Python"
   # Agents coordinate, winner creates files in workspace
   # Workspace saved to .massgen/sessions/session_abc123/

   Turn 2: "Add a dark mode toggle"
   # Agents see previous workspace, coordinate on improvements
   # Winner modifies existing files

.. seealso::
   * :doc:`sessions/multi_turn_mode` - Complete interactive mode guide including commands, session management, and debugging
   * :doc:`tools/mcp_integration` - Using MCP tools in multi-turn sessions
   * :doc:`advanced/planning_mode` - Prevent premature tool execution during coordination

External Framework Integration
-------------------------------

AG2 Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Integrate :term:`AG2` framework as a custom tool:

.. code-block:: yaml

   agents:
     - id: "ag2_assistant"
       backend:
         type: "openai"
         model: "gpt-4o"
         custom_tools:
           - name: ["ag2_lesson_planner"]
             category: "education"
             path: "massgen/tool/_extraframework_agents/ag2_lesson_planner_tool.py"
             function: ["ag2_lesson_planner"]
       system_message: |
         You have access to an AG2-powered tool that uses
         nested chats and group collaboration.

AG2's multi-agent orchestration patterns are wrapped as tools that MassGen agents can invoke.

See :doc:`integration/general_interoperability` for details.

File Operation Safety
---------------------

Read-Before-Delete Enforcement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MassGen prevents accidental file deletion:

* Agents must read a file before deleting it
* Exception: Agent-created files can be deleted
* Clear error messages when operations blocked

Directory Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* All paths validated at startup
* Context paths must be directories, not files
* Absolute paths required

Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~

* **During coordination**: All context paths are READ-ONLY
* **Final presentation**: Winning agent gets configured permission (read/write)

See :doc:`files/file_operations` for safety features.

System Architecture
-------------------

Execution Flow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Load Configuration**

   Parse :term:`YAML configuration`, validate paths, initialize :term:`agents<Agent>`

2. **Coordination**

   * Agents work in parallel, each seeing recent answers from others
   * Each agent decides: provide new answer or vote for existing answer
   * When agent provides answer, :term:`workspace` :term:`snapshot` is captured
   * Other agents see snapshots in their :term:`temporary workspace`
   * Continues until all agents have voted

3. **Winner Selection**

   Agent with most votes is selected as :term:`final agent`

4. **Final Presentation**

   * Winning agent delivers the coordinated final answer
   * If using :term:`context paths<Context Path>` with write permission, winning agent can update project files

5. **Output**

   Results displayed, logged, and workspace snapshots saved

Real-Time Visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MassGen provides rich terminal UI showing:

* Agent coordination table
* Voting progress
* Consensus detection
* Streaming responses
* Phase transitions

Disable with ``--no-display`` for simple text output.

State Management & .massgen Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MassGen organizes all working files under the :term:`.massgen Directory` in your project root. This keeps MassGen state separate from your project files.

**Directory Structure:**

.. code-block:: text

   .massgen/
   ├── workspaces/              # Agent workspaces
   │   ├── agent1_workspace/    # Agent 1's isolated workspace
   │   └── agent2_workspace/    # Agent 2's isolated workspace
   ├── snapshots/               # Workspace snapshots for sharing
   │   └── agent1_snapshot_1/   # Agent 1's snapshot from coordination round 1
   ├── temp_workspaces/         # Temporary workspaces for viewing others' work
   │   └── agent1/              # Agent 2 can see Agent 1's work here
   ├── sessions/                # Multi-turn session history
   │   └── session_abc123/      # Saved session state
   └── logs/                    # Execution logs

**Key Features:**

* **Workspace isolation** - Each agent has private workspace under ``workspaces/``
* **Snapshot sharing** - Agents share work via ``snapshots/`` during coordination
* **Session persistence** - Multi-turn conversations saved in ``sessions/``
* **Clean separation** - All MassGen files kept separate from your project
* **Git-friendly** - Add ``.massgen/`` to ``.gitignore`` to exclude from version control

**How State Persists:**

1. **During coordination**: Agent workspaces and snapshots are created/updated
2. **Between turns**: Session state saved to ``sessions/`` directory
3. **On restart**: Sessions can be resumed from saved state
4. **Final presentation**: Winner's workspace contains the final output

See :doc:`files/project_integration` for using ``.massgen`` with your existing codebase.

Common Patterns
---------------

Research Tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: yaml

   agents:
     - id: "gemini"  # Fast web search
       backend:
         type: "gemini"
         model: "gemini-2.5-flash"
     - id: "gpt5"   # Deep analysis
       backend:
         type: "openai"
         model: "gpt-5-nano"

Coding Tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: yaml

   agents:
     - id: "coder"  # Code execution
       backend:
         type: "claude_code"
         cwd: "workspace"
     - id: "reviewer"  # Code review
       backend:
         type: "gemini"

Hybrid Teams
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: yaml

   agents:
     - id: "ag2_executor"  # AG2 framework tool
       backend:
         custom_tools:
           - name: ["ag2_lesson_planner"]
             # ... AG2 tool config
         type: "openai"
         # ... backend config
     - id: "claude_analyst"  # File operations
       backend:

         # ... MCP config
     - id: "gemini_researcher"  # Web search
       backend:
         type: "gemini"

Best Practices
--------------

1. **Start Simple** - Begin with 2-3 agents, add more as needed
2. **Diverse Models** - Mix different providers for varied perspectives
3. **Clear Roles** - Give each agent specific system messages
4. **Use MCP** - Leverage tools for enhanced capabilities
5. **Enable Planning Mode** - For tasks with irreversible actions
6. **Context Paths** - Work with existing projects safely
7. **Interactive Mode** - For iterative development
