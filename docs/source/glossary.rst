Standard terminology used throughout MassGen documentation.

   Agent
      An AI assistant configured with a specific backend (model) and capabilities. Agents work independently or collaborate with other agents to solve tasks.

   Attempt
      A single orchestration execution within a :term:`Turn`. If orchestration fails or restarts (due to errors, timeouts, or explicit restart requests), each restart creates a new attempt. Attempts are numbered sequentially (attempt_1, attempt_2, etc.). Most turns complete in a single attempt. See also: :term:`Turn`, :term:`Round`.

   Backend
      The AI model provider integration (e.g., OpenAI, Claude, Gemini). Each backend connects to a specific AI service and provides access to its models.

   Claude Code
      Anthropic's development-focused AI assistant with native file operation tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob). Backend type: ``claude_code``.

   Consensus
      Agreement among agents on the best solution. Agents reach consensus through voting and refinement during coordination phases.

   Context Path
      A shared directory that agents can access during multi-agent collaboration. Context paths have permissions (read or write) and enable project integration.

   Coordination Phase
      The period when agents observe each other's solutions and vote on the best approach. During coordination, agents can refine their answers based on others' work. Coordination completes when all agents have voted.

   Round
      A single LLM call cycle for an agent during coordination, where the agent receives the current context (previous answers), processes it, and produces output (either a ``new_answer`` or a ``vote``). Multiple rounds occur as agents iteratively refine solutions. Each round includes: receiving context → LLM streaming → tool execution (if any) → output. See also: :term:`Turn`, :term:`Attempt`.

   Final Agent
      The agent whose solution is selected after coordination completes. This agent presents the final answer and can execute write operations to context paths.

   File Operation
      Reading, writing, editing, or deleting files in an agent's workspace or context paths. File operations require appropriate permissions.

   FileOperationTracker
      System component that enforces read-before-delete policies and tracks all file operations per agent for safety.

   LM Studio
      Local model inference tool that enables running open-weight models on your machine. Backend type: ``lmstudio``.

   MassGen
      Multi-Agent Scaling System for GenAI. A framework for running multiple AI agents collaboratively to solve complex tasks.

   MCP (Model Context Protocol)
      A protocol for integrating external tools and services with AI models. MCP servers provide tools like web search, filesystem access, or API integrations.

   MCP Planning Mode
      Coordination strategy where agents plan tool usage without execution during coordination. Only the final agent executes MCP tools to prevent duplicate actions.

   MCP Server
      A service that implements the Model Context Protocol and provides tools to agents. Examples: weather service, filesystem access, web search.

   Multi-Turn Mode
      Interactive conversation mode where you can continue asking questions across multiple turns. Session history is preserved in ``.massgen/sessions/``.

   Orchestrator
      System component that manages agent coordination, voting, workspace management, and session handling.

   Planning Mode
      See :term:`MCP Planning Mode`.

   Session
      A multi-turn conversation saved in ``.massgen/sessions/``. Sessions preserve context across multiple :term:`turns<Turn>` with the same agent team. A session can span multiple user interactions over time.

   Turn
      A single user interaction in a :term:`Session`. Each turn represents one question/task submitted to the agents, triggering a complete coordination cycle. In multi-turn mode, turns are numbered sequentially (turn_1, turn_2, etc.). Each turn may have one or more :term:`attempts<Attempt>`. The log directory structure is: ``log_TIMESTAMP/turn_N/attempt_N/``. See also: :term:`Round`, :term:`Attempt`.

   Snapshot
      A workspace state captured during coordination. Snapshots allow agents to share file-based work with each other.

   Streaming
      Real-time delivery of LLM responses as they are generated, rather than waiting for the complete response. MassGen uses streaming for all LLM calls, enabling live progress display and early tool execution detection.

   Stream Chunk
      A single piece of data from a streaming LLM response. Chunk types include: ``content`` (text), ``tool_calls`` (function invocations), ``reasoning`` (thinking), and ``done`` (completion signal).

   Snapshot Storage
      Directory where workspace snapshots are stored. Configured via ``orchestrator.snapshot_storage`` in YAML.

   System Message
      Instructions or role description provided to an agent to customize its behavior. Also called "system prompt."

   Temporary Workspace
      Directory storing previous turn results for context in multi-turn sessions. Configured via ``orchestrator.agent_temporary_workspace``.

   Voting
      Process where agents evaluate solutions and cast votes for the best answer during coordination rounds.

   Voting Config
      Orchestrator settings controlling voting behavior, including consensus threshold and voting rules.

   Voting Threshold
      Minimum percentage of agent votes required to select a final answer. Configured as 0.0-1.0 (e.g., 0.6 = 60%).

   Workspace
      Isolated directory where an agent performs file operations. Each agent has its own workspace under ``.massgen/workspaces/``.

   Workspace Isolation
      Security feature ensuring each agent's file operations are contained in their own workspace, preventing accidental interference.

   YAML Configuration
      Human-readable configuration file format used to define agents, backends, and orchestrator settings in MassGen.

   .massgen Directory
      Organizational directory created by MassGen to store all working files: sessions, workspaces, snapshots, temporary files, and logs.

Deprecated Terms
================

The following terms were used in earlier versions but are no longer preferred:

.. glossary::
   :sorted:

   Working Directory
      **Deprecated**. Use :term:`Workspace` instead. The ``cwd`` parameter still refers to the workspace directory.

   Shared Directory
      **Deprecated**. Use :term:`Context Path` instead. Context paths are the current terminology for shared project directories.

   Winning Agent
      **Deprecated**. Use :term:`Final Agent` instead. This is the agent selected after coordination completes.

   Final Presentation Agent
      **Deprecated**. Use :term:`Final Agent` instead. Simpler terminology preferred.

   Provider
      **Deprecated**. Use :term:`Backend` instead. Backend is more precise as it refers to the integration code, not just the service provider.

   External Tool
      **Deprecated** when referring to MCP. Use :term:`MCP Server` or :term:`MCP (Model Context Protocol)` instead.

   MCP Tool
      **Ambiguous**. Clarify whether you mean an :term:`MCP Server` (the service) or a specific tool provided by an MCP server.

Usage Examples
==============

**Correct terminology in documentation:**

.. code-block:: rst

   The :term:`final agent` executes write operations to :term:`context paths<Context Path>`.

   Agents use :term:`MCP servers<MCP Server>` to access external tools.

   Each agent has an isolated :term:`workspace` under ``.massgen/workspaces/``.
