# Design: TUI Mode System

## Context
The Textual TUI needs native mode toggles to seamlessly switch between different multi-agent workflows without CLI restarts. This brings MassGen's multi-agent capabilities into a simple coding agent UX.

**Stakeholders**: TUI users who want quick mode switching during interactive sessions.

## Goals / Non-Goals

### Goals
- Enable plan→execute workflow entirely within TUI
- Allow single-agent mode without restarting with different config
- Toggle refinement behavior (voting) on/off
- Override final answer selection before presentation
- Preserve context across mode changes

### Non-Goals
- Dynamic agent addition/removal during session (future work)
- Custom voting strategies (beyond on/off)
- Multi-agent refinement auto-prompts (noted as future enhancement)
- Post-completion override/redo (deferred to future spec)

## Decisions

### Decision: Mode State Location
Store mode state in a dedicated `TuiModeState` dataclass on the TextualApp instance.

**Rationale**: Centralizes mode logic, makes it easy to serialize/restore, and keeps compose() clean.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Scatter state across multiple widgets → harder to reason about, sync issues
- Store in orchestrator → TUI shouldn't depend on orchestrator internals

### Decision: Mode Bar Position
Position Mode Bar inside `#input_area` container, above the input hint line.

**Rationale**: User's eyes are near input area; mode toggles are quick-access controls.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Header → too far from input, breaks visual flow
- Status bar → too small, cluttered with agent status

### Decision: Single-Agent Voting Behavior
Single agent keeps voting when refinement is ON. Only skip voting when refinement is OFF.

**Rationale**: The vote acts as a "I'm done refining" signal. Even with one agent, allowing them to decide "my answer is ready" vs "let me try again" is valuable for iterative refinement.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Always skip voting for single agent → loses the "I'm satisfied" signal
- Force vote after first answer → too rigid, doesn't allow refinement

### Decision: Override Timing
Allow override AFTER voting completes but BEFORE final presentation starts.

**Rationale**: Chosen agent can write to workspace normally. No special handling needed. Post-completion redo adds complexity (workspace conflicts) - defer to future spec.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Post-completion redo → workspace file conflicts, complex recovery needed
- Only during voting → too restrictive, user may not have reviewed all answers yet

## Risks / Trade-offs

### Risk: Mode State Drift
If mode state gets out of sync with orchestrator config during long sessions.

**Mitigation**: Mode state generates config overrides fresh on each turn. No persistent orchestrator-side state.

### Risk: Plan Mode Subprocess Complexity
Running planning phase may spawn subprocess or require async orchestrator call.

**Mitigation**: Use existing PlanStorage infrastructure. Planning runs through normal orchestrator with planning flag.

## Key Integration Points

### TUI → Controller → Orchestrator Flow
```
TextualApp._mode_state
    ↓ get_orchestrator_overrides()
InteractiveSessionController._run_turn()
    ↓ merge overrides into config
Orchestrator.chat() with modified config
```

### Single-Agent Tab Selection
```
User clicks tab in single-agent mode
    ↓ AgentTab.on_click()
    ↓ _mode_state.selected_single_agent = agent_id
    ↓ _tab_bar.set_single_agent_mode(True, agent_id)
    ↓ Other tabs get "disabled" class
```

### Override Flow
```
Voting completes
    ↓ TUI shows: "Press Ctrl+O to override, Enter to continue"
    ↓ If Ctrl+O: show OverrideModal with all answers
    ↓ User selects different agent
    ↓ Set orchestrator._selected_agent = chosen_agent
    ↓ Continue to presentation phase
    ↓ Chosen agent does final presentation
```

## Open Questions
- Should mode bar be collapsible/hideable for minimal UI mode? (defer)
- Should we persist mode state across TUI restarts? (defer)
